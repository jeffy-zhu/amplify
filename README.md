# Amplify

A web app that makes learning how to play your favorite songs on the guitar easier.

It pulls data from the [Songsterr API](https://www.songsterr.com/a/wa/api), [Last.fm API](https://www.last.fm/api), and [Lyrics.ovh API](https://lyricsovh.docs.apiary.io/#).

## Features

- Songs can be looked up either by artist name or song title
- Displays the cover art of the album that the song is from
- Provides the metadata of the song, such as its lyrics and a general summary
- Clicking on the green "tabs" button opens up guitar tabs to the song in a new browser tab
